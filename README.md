***“Drone Flight Dataset and Lightweight LSTM-Based Wind Estimation for Semi-Autonomous Quadcopter Control”***
*(IEEE Access, 2025)*

The paper presents a real-world drone flight dataset collected under controlled wind disturbances and introduces a lightweight LSTM-based wind estimation model. The model predicts real-time wind effects from onboard sensor data and improves semi-autonomous quadcopter control by reducing drift, stabilizing attitude, and ensuring safer landings. The work demonstrates how accurate wind prediction can be embedded into resource-limited UAVs to enhance reliability during field operations.
